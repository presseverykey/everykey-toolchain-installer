#Toolchain Installer

This is our lame attempt at creating an installer pacakge
for the Press Any Key Toolchain. It should alert you to any missing
packages which we can't install automatically, download the compiler
and check out our SDK from github and get everything ready for you.

From our experience in workshops, installing the toolchain, which you
only need to do once, coincidentally, is a bit frustrating. This
script is meant to accelerate the process. Unfortunately, the state
of open source tools for serious embedded development is such that
it's aimed towards expert users, i.e. there's a "steep learning curve".

Just stick with it, it gets easier.
